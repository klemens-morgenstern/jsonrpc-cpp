Installation
============

Requirements
-------------

- C++ compiler toolchain;
- python;
- scons;
- JsonCpp library installed (http://jsoncpp.sourceforge.net/): 
  Once JsonCpp is compiled, copy the include files to /usr/local/include/json/ directory and libjson_*.so (found in bin/<your_platform>/) to /usr/local/lib/libjson.so

Build
------

To build the project: 
$ scons

To clean up the project: 
$ scons -c

Install
--------

On Unix systems, simply run as root: 
# scons install

This command will install include files in /usr/local/include/jsonrpc/include/ and 
libjsonrpc.so file in /usr/local/lib/

Examples
---------

JsonRpc-Cpp provides simple TCP and UDP JSON-RPC servers.

After JsonRpc-Cpp installation, you can build the examples:
$ scons examples

This will build test/tcp-server and test/udp-server examples.
Note that servers will be bind to localhost, port 8086.

To run the TCP JSON-RPC server:
$ test/tcp-server

To test it, on another terminal, run:
$ telnet localhost 8086
{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"system.print"}

You should see:
{"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"success"}

To run the UDP JSON-RPC server:
$ test/udp-server

To test it, on another terminal run:
$ netcat -u localhost 8086
{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"system.print"}

You should see:
{"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"success"}

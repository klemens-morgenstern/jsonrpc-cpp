JsonRpc-Cpp coding style
=========================

I) Code layout
--------------

The code has to follow ANSI coding standard layout. Use 2 space indentation instead 
of tabs.

void foo(int barc, char** barv)
{
  int test = 0;
  bool run = true;
  size_t i = 0;

  if(test)
  {
    /* do something */
  }
  else
  {
    /* do other thing */
  }

  while(run)
  {
    /* do loop */
  }

  for(i = 0 ; i < 2 ; i++)
  {
    /* do other loop */
  }

  do
  {
    /* do another loop */
  }while(run);
}

The C++ comments ('//') can be used as well as the C comments ('/* */').

/* my short comment */

// another short comment

/* a longer comment
 * on multiple lines
 * ...
 */

II) Code organization
---------------------

The code has to follow these recommendations:
- Always initialize your variables;
- Put "static" keyword if functions / global variables are not used outside a C++ file (not in header file);
- Try to avoid static variables in functions (try to make reentrant things);
- Prefer using size_t/ssize_t instead of int/unsigned int when possible;
- Use "const" keyword for pointers and references if they should not been modified in function/method;
- Use "const" keyword for methods if they do not modified class variables;
- Put a space before and after operator +/-* i.e. a + b - ((c * 5) / 3);
- Put an empty line at the end of each file.

Naming has to follow these recommendations:
- File name has to be in lower case, words are separated by  "_" (core files) or "-" (test and application-level files);
- Class and method name respect the CamelCase convention (MyClass::MyMethod);
- All class member variables name must be prefixed with "m_" (m_var);
- Function name should be in lower case, words are separeted by a "_" character (my_function);
- Each global variable must be prefixed with "g_" (g_run).

Each file, function, structure, class and global variable MUST be documented using doxygen.
Here is a complete example:

/**
 * \file my_file.h
 * \brief Short description.
 * \author Name
 * \date 2008
 */

#ifndef MY_FILE_H
#define MY_FILE_H

/**
 * \struct my_struct
 * \brief Short description.
 */
struct my_struct
{
  int a; /**< Description of a */
  char b; /**< Description of b */
};

/**
 * \var g_my_var
 * \brief Description of this global variable.
 */
struct my_struct* g_my_var = NULL;

/**
 * \class MyClass
 * \brief Short description of MyClass.
 */
class MyClass
{
  public:
    /**
     * \brief Constructor.
     */
    MyClass();

    /**
     * \brief Destructor.
     */
    ~MyClass();

    /**
     * \brief If count reach maximum.
     * \param count parameter description
     * \return true if count reach maximum, false otherwise
     */
    bool IsMax(size_t count);

  private:
    /**
     * \brief Member description.
     */
    size_t m_count;
};

/**
 * \brief Doing something.
 * \param a number to use
 * \param b char to use
 * \return 0 if success, -1 otherwise
 */
int foo(int a, char b);

#endif /* MY_FILE_H */

III) Standards
---------------

In order to compile and run on many operating systems the code has to be portable. Thus
it is strongly recommended to write code which respects C++98 and POSIX standards.
